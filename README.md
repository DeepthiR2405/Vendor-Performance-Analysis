# 📊 Vendor Performance & Profitability Analysis

A Business-Driven Data Analytics Project

# ❓Business Problem

How can a retail/wholesale organization improve profitability by identifying high-value vendors, controlling cost leakages (freight & pricing), and eliminating loss-making vendor relationships?

In competitive retail and wholesale environments, profitability is often impacted by:

* Inefficient vendor pricing

* High freight and procurement costs

* Low-margin or loss-making vendors

* Uneven contribution of vendors to overall revenue and profit

This project aims to analyze vendor performance holistically and provide data-backed recommendations to optimize vendor strategy and purchasing decisions.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

* Identify top-performing and underperforming vendors

* Analyze sales, cost, freight, and gross profit drivers

* Measure freight impact on vendor profitability

* Segment vendors based on business value

* Provide actionable business recommendations for cost optimization and vendor rationalization

# 🧠 Key Business Questions Answered

* Which vendors generate maximum revenue but low profit?

* Are freight costs significantly eroding margins for certain vendors?

* Which vendors should be:

  * Scaled

  * Negotiated with

  * Reviewed or terminated?

* How does cost efficiency differ across vendors?

# 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset represents transactional purchase and sales data at a vendor level, including:

* Vendor details

* Purchase quantity & cost

* Sales quantity & revenue

* Freight costs

* Derived profitability metrics

📌 The analysis focuses on vendor profitability and cost efficiency based on the data available.

* Vendor Segmentation Labels

# 📊 Analysis Highlights
🔹 KPI Summary

* Identified overall negative gross profit, indicating pricing or cost inefficiencies

* Highlighted vendors contributing to losses despite high sales

🔹 Vendor Profitability Analysis

* Clear distinction between high-revenue vs high-profit vendors

* Detection of vendors with unsustainable cost structures

🔹 Freight Impact Analysis

* Identified vendors where freight cost significantly impacts margins

* Highlighted cost-optimization opportunities

🔹 Vendor Segmentation

Vendors were segmented into:

* Strategic Vendors

* Growth Potential Vendors

* Low-Value Vendors

* Terminate / Review Vendors

This segmentation enables data-driven vendor decision-making.

# 💡 Business Recommendations

* Renegotiate pricing or freight terms with high-revenue but low-margin vendors

* Prioritize Strategic Vendors for long-term partnerships

* Review or discontinue vendors with persistent negative profitability

* Optimize procurement strategy to reduce freight cost leakages
