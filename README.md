📊 Vendor Performance & Profitability Analysis

A Business-Driven Data Analytics Project

❓ Business Problem

How can a retail/wholesale organization improve profitability by identifying high-value vendors, controlling cost leakages (freight & pricing), and eliminating loss-making vendor relationships?

In competitive retail and wholesale environments, profitability is often impacted by:

Inefficient vendor pricing

High freight and procurement costs

Low-margin or loss-making vendors

Uneven contribution of vendors to overall revenue and profit

This project aims to analyze vendor performance holistically and provide data-backed recommendations to optimize vendor strategy and purchasing decisions.

🎯 Project Objectives

Identify top-performing and underperforming vendors

Analyze sales, cost, freight, and gross profit drivers

Measure freight impact on vendor profitability

Segment vendors based on business value

Provide actionable business recommendations for cost optimization and vendor rationalization

🧠 Key Business Questions Answered

Which vendors generate maximum revenue but low profit?

Are freight costs significantly eroding margins for certain vendors?

Which vendors should be:

Scaled

Negotiated with

Reviewed or terminated?

How does cost efficiency differ across vendors?

🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset represents transactional purchase and sales data at a vendor level, including:

Vendor details

Purchase quantity & cost

Sales quantity & revenue

Freight costs

Derived profitability metrics

📌 The analysis focuses on vendor profitability and cost efficiency based on the data available.

Vendor Segmentation Labels

📊 Analysis Highlights
🔹 KPI Summary

Identified overall negative gross profit, indicating pricing or cost inefficiencies

Highlighted vendors contributing to losses despite high sales

🔹 Vendor Profitability Analysis

Clear distinction between high-revenue vs high-profit vendors

Detection of vendors with unsustainable cost structures

🔹 Freight Impact Analysis

Identified vendors where freight cost significantly impacts margins

Highlighted cost-optimization opportunities

🔹 Vendor Segmentation

Vendors were segmented into:

Strategic Vendors

Growth Potential Vendors

Low-Value Vendors

Terminate / Review Vendors

This segmentation enables data-driven vendor decision-making.

💡 Business Recommendations

Renegotiate pricing or freight terms with high-revenue but low-margin vendors

Prioritize Strategic Vendors for long-term partnerships

Review or discontinue vendors with persistent negative profitability

Optimize procurement strategy to reduce freight cost leakages
